# About
I am a Master's student in the University of Arizona's Human Langauge Technology program. In 2023 I graduated Magna cum Laude from the University of Arizona with a BA in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.

## Why Lingistics
When I went back to school in 2019 I chose Linguistics because of a life long interest in language and how it works. As a writer and performer, I had invested so much time in *what* language can do, and felt driven to understand *how* language does what it does. 

At the U of A, I studied Syntax Semantics, Phonology, Phonetics, Language Revitalization, and Computational Linguistics. I was drawn to Semantics and Pragmatics the most. The more mathematical elements of the discipline were very interesting to me, and I took a lot of joy in learning about Quantifier Scope and Table Models of Discourse. I was fortunate enough to spend a lot of hours learning from Dr. Robert Henderson, and many more reading whatever he told me too. 

## Why NLP
Since I was already studying Computer Science and the UofA offered an Accelerated Master's in HLT, it just made too much sense to go into NLP. I love problem solving and I love language so the field is a perfect dovetail of my interests. 

Since joining the program I've enjoyed putting my Linguistic background to work in a mechanical way. I've been able to use my understanding of Semantics to get my head around Word Embeddings and my syntax knowledge has proved useful over and over again.

I've been lucky to work with some great professors on side projects as well, working on Authorship Verification projects with Dr. Gus Hahn Powell, and on some simple Uspanteko Corpus manipulation with Dr. Robert Henderson.

I recently completed an internship with LUM AI working in ODIN-based Information Extraction on technical and contract documents, which was an exciting challenge.

I'm interested in growing my skills in Generative NLP and 

If I'm not working or spending time with my family, you can usually find me at [Rocks and Ropes](https://rocksandropes.com/) or on [Mt. Lemmon](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106822076/mount-lemmon-santa-catalina-mountains), trying to prove you can be both terrified, and climb.
