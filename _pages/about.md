# About
I am a student in the University of Arizona's Human Langauge Technology MS. I hold a Bachelor's in Linguistics with a minor in Computer Science, also from the University of Arizona, where I graduated Magna cum Laude. The Linguistics department did not have official specializations for their undrgraduate degree, I focused particularly in Semantics, studying mostly under Dr. Robert Henderson. In my CS classes I learned core programming concepts as well as Java and Python.

My NLP interests are primarily in Information Extraction. The distillation of complex resources into relevant details is a thrilling pursuit. Proficiency in ODIN and simple classifiers can yield fast, robust IE systems. I have also begun to play around more with HuggingFace transformers, and have been enjoying improving in that area of the discipline as well.

If I'm not working or spending time with my family, you can usually find me at [Rocks and Ropes](https://rocksandropes.com/) or on [Mt. Lemmon](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106822076/mount-lemmon-santa-catalina-mountains), trying to prove you can be both terrified, and climb.
