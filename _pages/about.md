# About
I am a student in the University of Arizona's Human Langauge Technology MS. I hold a Bachelor's in Linguistics with a minor in Computer Science, also from the University of Arizona, where I graduated Magna cum Laude. 

My NLP interests are primarily in Information Extraction. The distillation of complex resources into relevant details is a thrilling pursuit. Proficiency in ODIN and simple classifiers can yield fast, robust IE systems.
